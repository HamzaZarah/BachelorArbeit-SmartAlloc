The assignment of students to exercise groups represents a classic assignment problem, which aims to optimize their preferences. While simple variants, where students only indicate a single preference, can be solved in polynomial time using algorithms such as weighted maximum matching, more complex variants become significantly more challenging. This thesis explores various versions of the assignment problem and applies combinatorial optimization techniques to find solutions. These include considering group and language preferences and evaluating algorithms like the Hungarian Method and an advanced Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) variant. 

The evaluation revealed that while the Hungarian Method approach is efficient for smaller problem sizes with limited complexity, its performance significantly degrades as the problem size and constraints, such as language and group preferences, increase. In contrast, the MILP-based SmartAlloc approach, although more resource-intensive for smaller problems, demonstrated superior flexibility and scalability in larger and more complex scenarios. These findings suggest that SmartAlloc is more suitable for real-world applications involving multiple constraints, while the Hungarian Method approach remains useful for simpler, more straightforward assignments.
